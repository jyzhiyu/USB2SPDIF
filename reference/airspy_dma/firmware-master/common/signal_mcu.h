Wait For Event.

 - an exception, unless masked by the exception mask registers or the current priority level
 - an exception enters the Pending state, if SEVONPEND in the System Control Register is set
 - a Debug Entry request, if debug is enabled
 - an event signaled by a peripheral or another processor in a multiprocessor system using the SEV instruction.
If the event register is 1, WFE clears it to 0 and completes immediately.
